XCODE installation

Hello, welcome to Dalio!

Please run the below commands in the terminal of your workstation to commence Deep Learning

1) git clone https://github.com/gtm2122/install.git
A folder called "install" should have been created with new scripts inside.

2) cd install

3)sh install.sh


A folder called " celeb_imgs" and "dataset_candidates" will have formed.
Here you will select the dataset that you want to train the neural network to recognize.
Pick a folder of your liking from celeb_imgs and copy it to dataset_candidates. 
You can start with a few celebs and then gradually increase. I recommend starting with 3.

4) python arrange_data.py

This script will arrange the images in dataset_candidates into Training , Validation and Testing set.

5) python Train_Script.py

This script will train a neural network on the images that you selected.

6) python Test_Script.py

This script will test the trained neural network on images that were previously unseen.
Any Misclassifed images will be displayed in a folder called "misc".


Let me know if anything does not work. This script was not tested on a Mac so it is possible that you may face problems.
If so, let me know, I will fix it :)


Have Fun!
